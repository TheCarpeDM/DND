# DND - Build-A-Monster

## Overview of Project
We are creating a dashboard to allow a user to create their own Dungeons and Dragons (DND) Monster. The user will be able to input monster characteristics like size, hit points, etc and create a monster. The challenge rating and average level of the group will appear for the created monster.

## Project Timeline
**Current Status:**
- Data is cleaned and loaded into the database.
- Database and Learning Model are almost ready to be integrated.
- Dashboard has first mock up complete and is ready to start build and integration.

**Needs/Challenges:**

The large challenge that appears is dashboard build, because it requires a lot of moving parts with HTML, CSS, and JS to queue each piece of data and correctly output a challenge rating with the correct average level. The goal will be to try and get ahead on this to provide allotted time for unexpected road blocks in build.

**Plans for Future Work:** 
- Nailing down a learning model with our full dataset.
- Creating the shell for dashboard in HTML & CSS
- Creating the JavaScript that will run the queries to the database
